Monty Project README.md

The project requires reading commands (opcodes and arguments) arranged in a file for the MONTY bytecode interpreter.

Each line contains one and only one opcode.
The opcode could be preceded by whitespace and may be padded by whitespace after the argument
Any text after the opcode or the required argument is ignored.

Based on the above it was found that the batch module for the Simple Shell project can as well handle the reading and parsing of command lines from the interpreter's .m files. So a pragmatic decison was made to adopt and modify the code for this purpose. We give credit to the contributors to this Simple Shell project, namely Kpakpando Igwegbu and Boma Peple, in addition to Joy Ogbu for helping to repackage the new project.
